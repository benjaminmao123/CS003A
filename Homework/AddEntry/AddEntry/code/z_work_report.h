    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: add_entry, remove_entry, allocate, copy_list,
            search_entry, print_list, test_string()
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This was an interesting assignment. It gave me good
        practice with dynamic memory. Keeping track of where you allocate
        and when to delete is very important to prevent memory leaks.
