    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: add_entry, remove_entry, allocate, copy_list,
            search_entry, print_list, test_string()
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This was an interesting assignment. It gave me good
        practice using walkers instead of array notation to
        deal with pointers. I found it a bit tedious to keep
        having to declare walkers everytime so I wrote a little
        class to deal with it.
