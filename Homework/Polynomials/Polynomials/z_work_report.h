    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: Implemented all polynomial functions and 
            term functions.
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This was a good exercise to practice object-oriented
        design. I did have some trouble parsing strings which
        points out my weakness in string manipulation that I
        need to work on.
