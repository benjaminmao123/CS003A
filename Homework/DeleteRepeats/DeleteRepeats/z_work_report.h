    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: deleteRepeats is implemented
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This was an interesting assignment. It gave me good
        practice using walkers instead of array notation to
        deal with pointers.
