    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: All vector methods are implemented.
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        I thought this was a nice exercise to learn how to
        program your own container. I learned more about 
        overloading operators as well as handling dynamic
        memory.
