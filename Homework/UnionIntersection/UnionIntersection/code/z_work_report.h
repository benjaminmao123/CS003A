    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: union and intersection are implemented
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This was a fun assignment. It is a real brain wracker
        trying to figure out an efficient algorithm to compute
        the union and intersection.
