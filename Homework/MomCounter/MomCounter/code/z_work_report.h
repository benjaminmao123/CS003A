    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: All MCounter methods are implemented
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This was a good exercise to practice object-oriented
        design. I also learned that it is good to return something
        in a function to indicate its status.
