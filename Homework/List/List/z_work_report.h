    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: Big 3, InsertHead, InsertAfter, InsertBefore,
            InsertSorted, Delete, Print, Search, Prev, operator[],
            Begin, End, operator<<
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This assignment wasn't particularly hard since we have
        already implemented the lower level functions in the
        linked list library. It shows the importance of building
        higher level applications on top of a lower level API.
