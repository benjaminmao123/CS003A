    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: Implemented all polynomial functions and 
            term functions.
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This was a pretty easy assignment since we already had most
        of the low level logic built already. It really shows the 
        importance of composing higher level classes with lower
        level functions.
