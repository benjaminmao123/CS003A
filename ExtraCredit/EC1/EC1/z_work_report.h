        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This wasn't too hard of an assignment. It made me realize
        that I suck at typing on my laptop so I made a bunch of typos
        when coding which was annoying. I also had trouble documenting
        my code because I wasn't sure what information was important and
        what wasn't.
